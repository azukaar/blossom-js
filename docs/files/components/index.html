    <h1>HTML Components</h1>

    <p>
        Blossom JS comes packed with an optional `blossom-js-html` package, containing basic HTML components that you are very likely to want to 
        use in any Blossom app. A lot of them will probably remind you of Angular's own template system.
        This documentation provides an extensive description of each of theses components.
