<div id="container">
    <h1>L-META-ROUTE</h1>

    <p>
      Set the default route for your app. By default it will be `/` but if your app is hosted under http://example.com/myApp then your default route is /myApp/.
      Always use this at the very end of your head, or the very begining of your body.
