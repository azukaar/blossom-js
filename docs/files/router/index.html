    <h1>BLOSSOM ROUTER</h1>

    <p>Blossom-js comes shipped with a router system. This router uses the DOM and the current path to allow you to write menus and navigations modules</p>
    <p>The basic usage is to use the <d-cp c="route"></d-cp> component to define different path and use <d-cp c="a"></d-cp> to navigate</p>
    <p>use the menu on the left to learn more about them. By the way this menu uses blossom-js-router, so feel free to check out the source !</p>
