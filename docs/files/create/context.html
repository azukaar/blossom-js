<div id="container">
    <h1>CONTEXT</h1>

    <p>
        The context is the most basic concept to use Blossom. It is your to-go way to store any volatile data, like request responses, arrays of users' objects, etc...
        Two things need to be considered when manipulating your context :
        <p>Does it need to be in the context ? If no, you will induce additonal pointless render cycles</p>
        <p>
          Where ? this is crucial. Setting your ctx too deep in the DOM will cause issues, setting it too high will reduce performance.
          Basically most of the case the easy to solve this is :
          <ul>
            <li>
              if this is a user related data (like a todo list) it will be accessed from a lot of different places,
              therefore, set it on the default scope (the body). Or some place high
              <d-code DOM="true">
                <div>
                  <l-set foo="bar"></l-set> <!-- this will be set on the highest scope (here the div, by default it's body) -->
                </div>
              </d-code>
            </li>
            <li>
              if this is directly correlated to a component, set it directly on this component : example, a request response, a processing result. (See : l-json)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to give maximum control on your scope, you will need to use <d-cp c="context"></d-cp>. This component will allow you to set a context and limit its scope.

      <d-code>
        <l-ctx foo="bar">
          <l-js>this.ctx</l-js>
        </l-ctx>

        <l-js>this.ctx</l-js>
      </d-code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that in special cases you can sandbox the context with <d-cp c="closure"></d-cp>. Only use this if you know what you are doing.

      <d-code>
        <l-closure>
          <div>
            <l-set foo="bar"></l-set>
            <l-js>this.ctx</l-js>
          </div>
        </l-closure>
        <l-js>this.ctx</l-js>
      </d-code>
    </p>
</div>
